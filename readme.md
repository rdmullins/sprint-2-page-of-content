# Bootcamp Sprint 2: Structuring a Page of Content
## Roger Mullins / Team Da Vinci

### Minimum Viable Product
Project completed according to instructions and guidelines at [MDN Site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Structuring_a_page_of_content):
- HTML and CSS files created in Gitpod (rather than copied from MDN archive file)
- Semantic HTML wrappers added for:
    - Header
    - Navigation Menu
    - Main Content Area
    - Welcome Text
    - Image Side Bar
    - Footer
- CSS applied

### Stretch/Add=Ons
Beyond the above requirements I also:
- Ran HTML and CSS files through W3 validators
    - CSS passed on initial check
    - HTML had 6 errors/issues; all corrected
- Added my own content for the page
- Modified the navbar using `li :hover {}` selector to do the following on mouse-over:
    - Change the background color to a lighter shade
    - Turn on shadowing for the font
    - Change the default cursor to a pointer to indicate the link is clickable
- Added a site icon using the dove logo file
- Modified the image gallery so that images open in a new tab (`"target=_blank"`)
- Created this markdown file to highlight changes to the project
- (*Biggest Stretch*) added an interactive JS section
    - Users interract with the site using a series of buttons
    - Two arrays (button text and displayed text) are traversed as the user clicks through
    - An `if` test provides a fun treat at the end of the interaction
